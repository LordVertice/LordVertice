# information on [Lord Vertice]

welcome. this page contains all information i wish to make public about myself.

～　ｓｏｌ　ｏｎｓｅｔ　ｓｅｃｔｏｌ　～


## identity

you may call me vertice, vert, or v.  
it sounds like "vertis", not "vert-ice" or "vertease". ipa: /ˈvɝtɪs/ (approx.)

addressing me as "lord" is acceptable, but *not* preferred. however, you may do so if you struggle with pronouncing "vertice", or if that sounds too similar to the designation of a different present user.

i currently use the timezone `CEST (UTC＋2)`. to ease conversion: my midnight (00:00) is at 17:00 (5 PM) in `CDT (UTC-5)` (US central time).

~ *all remaining information regarding my identity is **[confidential]**, but i encourage you to probe deeper. you may request more data by establishing a connection to one or multiple of the channels listed below.* ~


## connect

i will not reveal my exact usernames here, but you might guess or otherwise find some if you probe deeper.

otherwise, to establish an initial connection contact me via **[email]**, ~~refer to my [github profile](https://github.com/LordVertice) to find the address (you must be logged in)~~. if you do not feel safe using email or if you don't want to log in, probe deeper to find a different connection point, or go to the section below.

but then again, why are you even here if you don't already have a connection with me? after all, that's one of the few ways you would've found this place!

~ *i predict that you are most likely coming from discord or vrchat. use that to connect with me on other channels, if you wish* ~

available channels for communication:
- discord.com (most active)
- ~~signal~~ (*you probably don't have the clearance to know my phone number at this point*)
- element.io (most secure)
- guilded.gg
- revolt.chat

alternative (unmaintained) channels: (these are still helpful if you want to reach out to me without email, especially twitter)
- twitter
- instagram

i am present on several other platforms, but only those usable for communication are listed here.

*the section below likely contains more complex data than you are equipped for.*  
***recommendation:** make necessary adjustments and continue forward, or [return](#information-on-lord-vertice) now.*

## connect securely, and/or verify my identify

you can utilize those cryptographic keys below to aid in secure communication, or to verify my identify in case one or more of the channels listed above are compromised.

if you want to prevent permanently losing contact in case our connections are severed, **please store all 3 of the following files somewhere safe where you won't lose them**, such as printed on paper in a drawer of your desk, or on a trusted storage device. if you lose them and my accounts get compromised, you'll have no way to reliably reconnect. this is a *VERY* unlikely scenario, but we have the means to prevent it.

if you just found me, all this likely wouldn't matter to you, but if we're friends without a connection irl to fall back to, you might want to look into this.

i keep the private part of these keypairs *[very safe]*. that means you can be certain that a valid signature really belongs to me, and that only i can decrypt your messages. the gpg keypair is secure too, but i'm phasing it out of use. i won't revoke it unless compromised, but it shouldn't be used regardless.

if you need to verify my identify, please challenge me to sign a message you give me, and assume the worst if "i" refuse.

this is all certainly overkill, but it never hurts to be prepared. i encourage you to learn these tools, too.
