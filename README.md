# information on [Lord Vertice]

welcome. this page contains all information i wish to make public about myself.

～　ｓｏｌ　ｏｎｓｅｔ　ｓｅｃｔｏｌ　～

## identity

you may call me vertice, vert, or v.

sounds like "vertis", not "vert-ice" or "vertease". ipa: /ˈvɝtɪs/ (approx.)

all other information regarding my identify is **[confidential]**. you may request more data by establishing a connection to one or multiple of the channels listed below.

## connect

i will not reveal my usernames on these channels in public, though you can technically find or guess some, if you probe deep enough. good job if you managed to do that.

to establish communication, contact me via **[email]**, refer to my [github profile](https://github.com/LordVertice). if you do not feel safe using email, i provided means of secure communication through insecure channels in the section below. using those, you can reach out to me using any public or untrusted channel of your choosing, as long as you can get my attention.

but then again, why are you even here if you don't already have a connection with me? after all, that's one of the few ways you would've found this place. just use your existing connection to converse or establish more connections.

~ *i predict that you are most likely coming from discord or vrchat. use that to connect with me on other channels, if you wish* ~

available channels for communication:
- discord.com (most active)
- ~~signal~~ (*very unlikely due to phone number requirement, but technically available*)
- element.io (most secure besides signal)
- guilded.gg
- revolt.chat

alternative (unmaintained) channels:
- twitter
- instagram

i am present on several other platforms, but only those usable for communication are listed here.

## connect securely, and/or verify my identify

i am moderately proficient in a few cryptographic tools that would aid in secure communication via insecure channels, or to verify my identify in case one or more of the channels listed above are compromised.

for this reason, ***even if you don't currently understand what this means***, if you want to prevent permanently losing contact in case our connection is severed, ***please store all 3 of the following files somewhere safe where you won't lose them***, such as printed on paper in a drawer of your desk, or on a trusted storage device. if you lose them and my accounts get compromised, you'll have no way to know it's me.

if you just found me, it likely wouldn't matter, but if we're friends without an irl connection to fall back to, you might want to do this.

i keep the private part of these keypairs *very safe*. if you see a valid signify signature for that key, that message is surely mine. if you encrypt something using the age key, only i will be able to read it. the gpg keypair is reasonably safe too, but i'm phasing it out of use. i won't revoke it unless compromised, but it is not preferred.

if you need to verify my identify, please feel free to challenge me to prove it with a signature, and assume the worst if i refuse.

this is certainly overkill, but it never hurts to be prepared. i encourage you to learn these tools, too.
