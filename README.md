# information on [Vertice]

welcome. this page contains all information i wish to make public about myself.

～　ｓｏｌ　ｏｎｓｅｔ　ｓｅｃｔｏｌ　～

<br>

## identity

you may call me vertice, vert, or v.  
it sounds like "vertis", not "vert-ice" or "vertease". ipa: `/ˈvɝtɪs/` (approx.)

addressing me as "lord" or "lord vertice" is tolerable, but not preferred. i will keep that title in usernames for legacy reasons, but will be removing it from my important display names where possible.

you might also know me as **[encoded;39//0x00ffff]**. if you do, then addressing me as that is acceptable, in some cases even encouraged.

pronouns: **[redacted]**. (you have the required clearance, so feel free to request this information manually in private)

current timezone: `CEST (UTC＋2)`. to ease conversion: my midnight (00:00) is at 17:00 (5 PM) in `CDT (UTC-5)` (US central time).  
*(**not** guaranteed to be synced with daylight savings at all times)*

~ *all remaining information regarding my identity is **[confidential]**, but i encourage you to probe deeper. you may request more data by establishing a connection to one or multiple of the channels listed below* ~

<br>

## connect

i will not reveal my exact usernames here, but you might guess or otherwise find some if you probe deeper.

to establish an initial connection, you may contact me via **[email]**. if you don't want to use email, contact one of the channels below. *(my email is currently not visible. a solution will be devised in time)*

### primary channels:
- `discord.com` fastest response time
- `guilded.gg`
- `revolt.chat`
- `matrix.org` | `element.io` **e2ee\*** and decentralized: **[matrix]** network  
   \**e2ee: end-to-end encryption*

### inactive channels:
*these are **inactive,** and not meant for direct communication. expect very slow response time.*  
*they will probably only be useful if you wish to share something there with me.*
- `kbin.social` decentralized: **[fediverse]** network
- `mastodon.social` decentralized: **[fediverse]** network

<br> *abandoned/unsuitable/sensitive channels have been omitted from these lists.*

if you see something up there you don't recognize, feel free to ask me about it~

## keys

you can utilize these cryptographic keys to aid in secure communication, or to verify my identify in case one or more of the channels listed above are compromised.

they allow you to do two things:
- send me messages that no one else can read
- verify a message was sent by me, not someone else who gained access to my account

`vertice-signify-key.pub` *(this is a signature verification key, to prove my identity with [signify](https://github.com/aperezdc/signify))*

	untrusted comment: emergency key for lord vertice, signify v31. public key
	RWRLJo3lwDHtIEH7eeF6j2a2EQA9zP5uIeoCXxWVwTMBQRXNYXBMc8lP

`vertice-age-recipient.txt` *(this is an encryption key, to encrypt a message for me using [age](https://age-encryption.org/))*

`vertice-gpg-fingerprint.txt` *(i'm phasing this out, but this is my [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) fingerprint, belonging to [this GPG key](https://github.com/LordVertice.gpg). i likely won't use it anymore)*

i keep the private part of these keypairs *very safe*. that means you can be certain that a valid signature really belongs to me, and that only i can decrypt your messages.

if you need to verify my identify, please challenge me to sign a message you determine. if i refuse, i'm not me.

this is all certainly overkill, but it never hurts to be prepared. i encourage you to learn these tools, too. who knows, might come in handy one day.
